        "My company, local coffee shop, assigned me to work on the customers' reviews from yelp. Nowadays, it is easier to access to receive customers feedback and all the feedbacks matter as it can boost the company sales or reduce the company sales. Previously, there are only handful of review, so our team can work on reviews manually. As internet user growth, it is a bit out of hand, I have been assigned to create a machine learning model which can provide whether customers reviews are positive, negative or neutral. This will help company to quickly see what area of the shop need to be improved and eventually increase the sales.\n",

It's so much easier to make good decisions about my diet when there aren't any bad options on the menu! I'm pretty sure most of their food is pre-made in a different location. It's all ready to go and waiting in the refrigerator but they do have hot tacos and amazing coffee. There are only 2 places in south Austin that serve bullet proof coffee and picnick opens an hour before the other place so I can actually get some on my way to work. Love it. If you're paleo or bullet proof, you have to try it. \",\n          \" 8/3/2016 30 check-ins What makes Brian's Brew special? The moon milk? The coffee? The fresh beans that arrive Tuesday and Wednesday? Or is it Sam. I offer to you fellow Yelp fans this- all the above. When you meet someone with a passion for what they do, add fresh spin and approach to coffee making you can't help but rave about Brian's Brew. In the morning get there early and enjoy the breakfast tacos before the building employees take advantage of this first floor coffee stop. Enjoy your morning greeting from Sam who provides that special touch transforming your morning cup of joe to a delightful coffee experience. Never have I described coffee the way I describe wine. This is an amazing stop and deserves to be shared and enjoyed. Take a walk over to the corner of 6th and Congress- enter into the mezzanine at the Bank of America building on the corner- put the Starbucks to your back and enjoy a coffee by Sam. Make sure to provide an email address and earn your stars for that future cup. I guarantee you will be back. \",\n          \" 12/1/2016 Trendy restaurant and nice atmosphere. You can sit inside or outside. I ordered Chai and Mango field salad. The salad had mixed greens with raspberry, mango, avocado and other fruits. Served with a tangy cilantro Lime dressing. The portion sizes are huge and the price is well worth it. I would like to come back to try more things off their menu. Only 2 drawbacks I experienced - filled up my chai so high that when I picked it up from the bar it spilled over on my hands (hot!) and you have to throw away your trash and put away the plates. If we are paying tip, I feel like full service should be included. Huge cup of chai!

        "Since I have created 2 models, there are difference requirement to properly train models. Firslty, as of the result of the model, using Transformer model is very effictive in term of evaluation result. However, using Transformer model would be time comsuming. Therefore, only sample of dataset can be training in order to save time and with the limited resource. On the other hand, using the Neural network can be a bit quite faster in term of model training with the Transformer model. However, the result of model is not as good as using transformer model.\n",
